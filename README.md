# Differential Expression Analysis in Multiple Sclerosis

This repository contains the code and obtained results from our analysis on the differential expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls, leveraging data collected from various studies and datasets. We investigated these expression differences in two primary cell populations: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cerebrospinal fluid cells (CSFs). Our analysis was particularly focused on exploring variations across different cell types, including T cells, B cells, Monocytes, Plasma cells, and Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs).
